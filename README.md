This is the Pinyto ToDo-List application for Ubuntu desktops.

You can view and edit your ToDo-List in Pinyto with this Application. Pinyto is a personal cloud database 
and app infrastructure used to collect, sync, analyze and access data from different devices. This 
application depends on the Pinyto daemon (https://github.com/Pinyto/daemon).

Development
-----------

This application was created using ``quickly``.

Run the code with ``quickly run``.

Edit the basic design with ``quickly design``. The list itself is created dynamically in 
``pinyto_desktop_todo/PinytoDesktopTodoWindow.py``.

I have not built a Debian package yet. The application still needs some development. This is released mainly
to show how a Pinyto application may work. I have planned to finish this application and ideally make it
installable via apt. If you want to help you can contact me at ``jonny@pinyto.de``.
